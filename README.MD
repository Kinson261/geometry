# Geometry
**Geometry** aims to help people to deal with geometry and linear algebra using c/cpp.  
  
# Motivation
I decided to create **Geometry** library out of my own needs. I deal with these functions in most of my project and decided to simplify my workflow by unifying everything in a single library. For now, I will be focusing on analitycal geometry and I will be expanding this library even further. 


# How to use  
Adding all files from `src` folder to your project is enough for using this library.
